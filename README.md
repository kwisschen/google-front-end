# google-front-end
In this project, I've designed a front-end for "classic" Google, including all features for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
A redirect notice may be encountered when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.
